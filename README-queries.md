## Overview

The `queries.js` file contains MongoDB queries for:
- Basic CRUD operations
- Advanced filtering, projection, sorting, and pagination
- Aggregation pipelines for analytics
- Index creation and performance analysis

These queries are designed for a `books` collection, typically in a database like `plp_bookstore`.

---

## Prerequisites

- **MongoDB** installed and running on your system.
- **MongoDB Shell** (`mongosh`) or MongoDB Compass for running queries.
- A database (`plp_bookstore`) with a `books` collection. Make sure your documents have fields like `title`, `author`, `genres`, `published_year`, `price`, `in_stock`, etc.
